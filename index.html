    <p>We're creating a web application to help people understand the impact of their food choices in a meaningful way.
        Our web application will allow users to choose from a list of foods
        provided and learn about the food, its environmental impact, and how can users can make alternative choices to decrease their impact.
        The goal of this web application is to encourage users to make more environmentally conscious food choices by presenting alternatives to their choices.
