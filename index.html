    <h3>our project</h3>
    <p>We're creating a web app to help people understand the impact of their food choices in a meaningful way.  
        Our app will allow users to input the foods in their diet and view the environmental impact of those foods.
        The app will also encourage people to make more environmentally conscious food choices by presenting alternatives to their choices.
